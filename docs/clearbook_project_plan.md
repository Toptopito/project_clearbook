* **Framework:** React or Vue.js. Both are excellent for building responsive Single Page Applications (SPAs). React has a larger ecosystem, while Vue.js is often praised for its gentle learning curve.
    * Consider building it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to offer offline capabilities and a native-app-like experience.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first rapid UI development, or a component library like Material-UI (for React) or Vuetify (for Vue.js).
* **State Management:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit (for React), Pinia (for Vue.js).
* **Charting:** Chart.js (simple, good for MVP) or Recharts (for React) / Vue-Chartjs (for Vue).

### Backend:
* **Language/Framework:**
    * **Node.js with Express.js or NestJS:** JavaScript full-stack, efficient for I/O-bound operations, large NPM ecosystem. NestJS offers a more structured, opinionated framework.
    * **Python with Django or Flask:** Python is strong for data processing and future AI/ML integration (e.g., OCR). Django is a full-featured "batteries-included" framework, while Flask is a microframework offering more flexibility.
* **API:** RESTful APIs are standard and easier to implement for an MVP. GraphQL could be an option later for more complex data fetching.

### Database:
* **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database with strong support for data integrity, security features, and JSONB for flexible data structures if needed. Excellent for structured health data.

### Cloud Platform & Hosting:
* AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. All provide scalable infrastructure and managed services.
* **Key Services:**
    * **Compute:** AWS EC2/ECS, GCP Compute Engine/GKE, Azure VMs/AKS.
    * **Managed Database:** AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, GCP Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
    * **File Storage (for lab report uploads):** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage. (Ensure these are configured for private, encrypted storage).
    * **Authentication:** AWS Cognito, Firebase Authentication (GCP), Azure AD B2C. These services handle secure user authentication, offloading significant security burdens.

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition) - Post-MVP:
* **Cloud Services:** AWS Textract, Google Cloud Vision AI, Azure Computer Vision.
* **Open Source:** Tesseract OCR (requires more setup and fine-tuning).

### Deployment & DevOps:
