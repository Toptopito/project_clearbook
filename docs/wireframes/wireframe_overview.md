# Clearbook - Wireframe Documentation

This document provides an overview of the wireframes for the Clearbook Personal Health Records application. The wireframes focus on the MVP features centered around lab results tracking and are based on the user stories documented in `user_stories.md`.

## Wireframe Structure

The wireframes are organized by user flow:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login
   - Registration
   - Password Reset
   - Logout

2. **Lab Result Management Flow**
   - Lab Result Dashboard/List View
   - Add New Lab Result
   - View Lab Result Details
   - Upload Lab Documents
   - Visualize Trends

3. **User Profile Flow**
   - View Profile
   - Edit Profile
   - Account Settings

## Design Principles

These wireframes follow these key design principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Focus on essential features with minimal visual clutter
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper contrast, readable text sizes, and clear navigation
3. **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile devices first, then scale up to desktop
4. **Clear hierarchy**: Establish visual hierarchy to guide users through tasks
5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent UI patterns throughout the application

## Navigation Structure

The application will use a bottom navigation bar on mobile and a side navigation on desktop/tablet with the following main sections:

- Dashboard (Home)
- Lab Results
- Documents
- Profile

## Color Scheme and Typography

The wireframes use a minimal color scheme to indicate various states and hierarchies:

- Primary action color: #1976D2 (blue)
- Secondary/accent color: #43A047 (green)
- Warning/alert color: #E53935 (red)
- Background color: #FFFFFF (white)
- Text color: #333333 (dark gray)

Typography:
- Primary font: Roboto (sans-serif)
- Font weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)
- Base font size: 16px

## Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 600px
- Tablet: 600px - 960px
- Desktop: > 960px

## Implementation Notes

These wireframes serve as a guide for UI development and may evolve during the implementation phase. The focus is on layout and information architecture rather than detailed visual design.
